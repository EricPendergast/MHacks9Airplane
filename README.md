# Cells-Game
This is a game I made for my final project in AP Computer Science. You play as a cluster of viruses and your goal is to infect the master cell.

Features a randomly generated series of arteries to move the viruses through, partol cells which alert the master cell of your position, and white blood cells which are sent by the master cell to attack your viruses.
